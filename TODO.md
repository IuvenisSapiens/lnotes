# Project Modernization TODO

Here is a list of proposed improvements to modernize the project:

1.  **Update the TeX Distribution:** The project should be updated to work with a modern TeX distribution like TeX Live or a recent version of MiKTeX. This will provide access to the latest packages and tools, improving compatibility and maintainability.

2.  **Update the LaTeX Source:** The LaTeX source code should be updated to use modern packages and practices. This includes:
    *   Replacing the manual font setup with a more robust solution using the `fontspec` package.
    *   Replacing `chapterbib` and `natbib` with `biblatex` for bibliography management.
    *   Reviewing the custom macros and layout settings to see if they can be simplified using modern packages.
